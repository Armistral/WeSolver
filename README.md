WeSolver
========

An open source web site for sharing problems and solutions to those problems.
Currently in the very initial phases of development, using the Microsoft Azure
platform.

Deprecated as the decision was made to move WeSolver to the SMW platform.  Please see http://www.wesolver.org

Some day we may come up with a better platform, until then thanks to everyone who was involved in this first Alpha!

Regards,
